# Motor Control with Arduino and H-Bridge Module

This project demonstrates a practical application of motor control using an Arduino and an H-Bridge module. The goal is to showcase how to control the speed and direction of a motor using this hardware.

## Required Materials

- Arduino Uno (or similar)
- H-Bridge Module (e.g., L298N)
- DC Motor
- Power supply for the motor

## Circuit Assembly

1. Connect the H-Bridge module to the Arduino, establishing connections for power, control, and signals.
2. Connect the motor to the H-Bridge module, ensuring correct polarity and wire connections.
3. Ensure a suitable power supply is connected to the H-Bridge module to power the motor.

## Operation

The code used to control the motor may vary depending on your specific project. Different methods for controlling motor speed and direction can be implemented.

Feel free to explore and modify the code as needed to meet the demands of your project.
